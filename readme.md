# Testing various git related things

This is a test repo.

## Commit 2

Contents of commit 2.

## Commit 3 (Branch: GIT-001)

Something of note here - I was not able to insert a whole Jira-like title as branch names cannot contain spaces. This does leave the working title of the branch a little easier to manage, but the availability of information is lower.

### Commit 4 (also in the branch)

Nothing in particular I want to say here.

## Commit 5 (Branch: GIT-002)

I'll be pushing this up to github.

## Commit 6 (Branch: GIT-003)
